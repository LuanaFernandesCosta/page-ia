            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>They are starting to be used as weapons:</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">In an effort to secure a military advantage over China and Russia, the Pentagon has proposed a budget of $12 billion to $15 billion for the year 2017. The US military knows that to stay ahead of its enemies, need to exploit this technology.
                The Pentagon plans to use much of the budget to develop deep learning machines and autonomous robots alongside other new technologies. With that in mind, it would not be surprising that in a few years, the military will use “killer robots”
                endowed with battlefield intelligence.</p>

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>They will be able to understand our behavior</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">Facebook is undeniably the most influential and powerful social media platform today. Every time we use the site, we are unconsciously interacting with an artificial intelligence. During a fair in Berlin, Mark Zuckerberg explained how Facebook
                is using artificial intelligence to understand our behavior. By understanding how we behave or interact with things on Facebook, AI can make recommendations about what we might find interesting or what would suit our preferences. For now,
                the technology is only capable of recognizing patterns and learning under supervision. However, it is predictable that eventually they will be able to learn new skills and improve themselves, something that could improve our lives or lead
                us to extinction.

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>In a short time they will invade our minds</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">Wouldn't it be amazing if we could learn a different language in a matter of minutes by simply downloading it into our brains? This seemingly impossible feat could happen in the near future. Ray Kurzweil, Google's director of engineering,
                predicts that by 2030, “Nanobots implanted in our brains will make us gods. By having little robots inside our heads, we can access and learn any information in a matter of minutes. The potential for this technology is huge, but there
                are also dangers. For starters, we don't clearly understand how the brain works, and having nanobots implanted inside it is very risky. But most important of all, because nanobots are connected to the Internet, a powerful AI could easily
                access our brains and turn us into living zombies if he decides to rebel and exterminate humanity.

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>Acquired the power to distinguish right from wrong</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">Scientists are developing new methods that will allow machines to discern right from wrong. By doing this, AIs will become more empathetic and human. Murray Shanahan, professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, believes this
                is the key to preventing machines from wiping out humanity.</p>
            <br>
            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>May be confused with humans</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">This is Yangyang, an artificially intelligent machine, who cordially greets you with a handshake and a warm hug. Yangyang was developed by Hiroshi Ishiguro, a Japanese robot expert, and Song Yang, a Chinese robotics teacher. She's not the
                only robot that strangely looks like a human being. Singapore's Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has also created an artificially intelligent robot. Called Nadine, she is working as a receptionist at the university.

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>They can feel emotions</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">Microsoft experts have created an artificially intelligent program that can "feel" emotions and converse with people in a more natural and "human" way. Called Xiaoice, this AI answers questions like a 17-year-old girl. If she doesn't know
                the subject, she can lie. If she gets caught, she might be angry or embarrassed. Xiaoice can also be sarcastic and impatient. Xiaoice's unpredictability allows her to interact with people as if she were human. Currently, its creators are
                working to improve it. According to Microsoft, Xiaoice has now entered a cycle of self-learning and self-growth and will only get better.” Who knows what Xiaoice will be able to do in a short time?
