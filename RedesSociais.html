                Digital marketing has an increasing complexity, far from the traditional one that was based on campaign planning, strategy driving, media planning, ad exposure and sales. Today, the close and immediate interaction of consumers and companies makes the
                techniques much more elaborate.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                The presence on social networks is apparently easy, but it requires great care to maintain positive and successful communication, with a focus on bringing the desired results.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Having a broader interaction and achieving the desired results requires investments. And, with the volume of interactions generated, it is also necessary to hire more people to not leave customers unanswered. The solution to this question is the use of
                artificial intelligence. Some social networks, such as Facebook, offer a kind of virtual collaborator, able to respond to messages, observe the page's movement and interact with its audience as if it were in fact an analyst. There is also
                the recognition of images in published photos and videos, which goes beyond the personal face and can identify the product even without the use of a hashtag. This way, the publication of a user no longer goes unnoticed by monitoring.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Facebook came out ahead with the implementation of artificial intelligence and offers its users the possibility of classifying their news feed, so that what is chosen as the most relevant is displayed. Its algorithms already have artificial intelligence,
                but they require impulses to be used in multimedia data. Meanwhile, Remarketing is the targeting of advertising on Facebook's timeline, based on the identification of the customer's profile and their web habits.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Another artificial intelligence tool is Big Data, a database that classifies customers based on their location, the types of purchases they have been making on the web, their browsing history and even their offline behavior. This analysis can be very
                accurate, to the point of knowing at which stage the customer is more prone to consumption or in need of a particular service. Collaborative filters are fundamental for online stores, screening site visitors by like-minded people. This
                product marketing tool identifies customers who made the same purchases and directs your campaigns to buy the same types of products in the coming months. This “customization package” streamlines actions and allows you to identify shopping
                patterns.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                When visiting a website, the visitor may come across a chatbot, an introductory conversation that serves to introduce the environment to the customer and gather basic information about their interests and contact. This artificial intelligence tool allows
                you to continue marketing to potential customers and eliminate the unlikely ones. Collecting customer information is one of the main focuses of artificial intelligence tools. The more data collected, the more personalized the strategy
                will be and the more assertive in the results. Understanding visitor behavior helps provide them with more innovative and impactful experiences, using the passive interface of artificial intelligence. It identifies the consumer's desires
                and needs, based on the collection of data on their consumption and behavior on the web. In this way, artificial intelligence can indicate the right solution for that customer and further improve their brand experience.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Another bias of artificial intelligence is the creation of fake profiles and sending fake messages to create numbers. Some may write reviews that don't exist but are positive for the brand and drive it forward. As well as some pages with a large number
                of followers, but with very little engagement, as most of them are created by artificial intelligence just to create volume. Artificial intelligence is a reality of our century and is present in practically everything in our daily lives.
                Especially in social networks, it has been streamlining and optimizing its use, creating a series of possibilities, both for the user and for companies.
