            <p class="p-custom">
                The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ originated in 1955, as spoken by John McCarthy, professor of mathematics at Dartmouth College. Already the following year, he organized a conference on the subject.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                An almost eight-week brainstorm by McCarthy with his colleagues, ML Minsky, N. Rochester, and C.E. Shannon, offered a vision for the future: experts believed in building computers to perform cognitive tasks, including abstraction and language use.

                    “All aspects of learning — or any other characteristic of intelligence — can, in principle, be described so precisely that a machine will be able to simulate them,” the program summarized.

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>The emergence of Machine Learning</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">
                In 1959, the term Machine Learning — in Portuguese, machine learning — appeared for the first time, describing a system that gives computers the ability to learn some functions without being programmed for that purpose. Translating, feeding an algorithm
                with data so that the machine learns to do something automatically.

                As early as 1964, the world met the first chatbot. It was ELIZA, created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. She talked automatically using keyword-based responses and semantic and syntactic structure.

                There have been great advances throughout history, but only now we have had this “boom”, due to the high processing capacity in the cloud that we achieved a few years ago. Of course: we cannot forget the large amount of data that we have available, forming
                the famous Big Data.

            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>How will our life be going forward with Artificial Intelligence?</strong></H3>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Artificial intelligence is the most powerful technological change in the field of computer science. Connecting diverse environments of life such as home, work, leisure, travel and more in a single experience. AI will not only help when we ask for it,
                but will accompany us, anticipate needs, help us make decisions, and remember important tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                The factor is how we are teaching computers to think. There are some tools for this teaching and some necessary technological principles: computer science such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, among others.
            </p>
            <p class="p-custom">
                All of these tools together make up artificial intelligence and indicate a future where our platforms and systems will have enough intelligence to learn from our interactions and data.
