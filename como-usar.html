                How Artificial Intelligence works is based on the combination of large volumes of digital data and intelligent algorithms. Respectively, they allow the system to read and interpret patterns and information to learn automatically. It is important to note
                that for this learning to happen, the Artificial Intelligence system needs to be constantly fed with new data.In general, the idea is to have a function in which, when a certain value is entered, another value arises. The important thing
                is to understand that these values are not random, but have a meaning and therefore a function. In the same way, computer codes are not random either, each of which is responsible for a role in the system. Thus, the operation of AI is
                based on:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>• Data model: structures used to process, categorize and analyze data;</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>• Big Data: making large volumes of data available;</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>• Processing power: this is the system's operational capacity to process information.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>• For this whole process to happen, however, it is necessary to combine different technologies that together can give the machine the ability to imitate human logical reasoning </li>
                </ol>
