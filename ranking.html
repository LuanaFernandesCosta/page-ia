            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>1 - Limited Artificial Intelligence (ANI):</strong></H3>
            </br>
            <p class="p-custom">
                Also called “weak AI”, they are intelligences with a single objective: to store large amounts of data and perform complex tasks, according to the schedule. This class of artificial intelligence can do complex calculations very quickly, but it doesn't
                go beyond that. In this classification, there are still two subcategories:
                <div class="custon-li">
                    <p class="p-custom">
                        <strong>• Reactive machines:</strong> these don't exploit as many resources. They do not store much data and react only to some stimuli, depending on their configuration;</br>
                        <strong>• Limited memory:</strong> more advanced, these store more data and use it to make decisions. This AI stores the data, based on the user's previous choices, and passes it on to similar content.</br>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </p>

            <br>
            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>2 - General artificial intelligence (AGI):</strong></H3>
            </br>
            <p class="p-custom">
                This type of artificial intelligence is "strong AI" or "human level" because it is capable of solving tasks similar to those performed by human beings. She learns through machine learning techniques, for example, in addition to understanding and reacting
                to specific stimuli. Furthermore, this model can be applied to tasks that are not performed by the ANI, but are not yet at the level of human intelligence. In this category th ere are two subdivisions:
                <div class="custon-li">
                    <p class="p-custom">
                        <strong>• Aware machines:</strong> see the world and are able to understand the stimuli received to process information;</br>
                        <strong>• Self-aware machines:</strong> these are aware of themselves and the world around them, facilitating the understanding of external stimuli. Reacts the same way as a human being. </br>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </p>

            <br>
            <H3 class="sub-title"><strong>3 - Superintelligence (ASI):</strong></H3>
            </br>
            <p class="p-custom">Among all of them, superintelligence is unknown for the future and is still under study. However, it is imagined that it will be superior to human intelligence, capable of making decisions and also storing data.
                <br>Furthermore, scientists think this superintelligence will be much broader. She may be a little superior to the human mind and even more intelligent, performing tasks that people cannot.</br>
                Therefore, scientific debates focus on this special artificial intelligence, which can totally change the way we see and understand the world. According to Gartner, the challenge for AI over the next 10 years will be based on how companies will manage
                to standardize the development of this technology, so that it is used in an ethical and safe manner.
